* Previously, the formatted output of 'ceph pg stat -f ...' was a full
  pg dump that included all metadata about all PGs in the system.  It
  is now a concise summary of high-level PG stats, just like the
  unformatted 'ceph pg stat' command.




* All JSON dumps of floating point values were incorrecting surrounding the
  value with quotes.  These quotes have been removed.  Any consumer of structured
  JSON output that was consuming the floating point values was previously having
  to interpret the quoted string and will most likely need to be fixed to take
  the unquoted number.
